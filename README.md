## Patterns Overview
 * ```Factory``` entities are generated in factory.h
 * ```Strategy``` supports three movement strategies: Automatic, Target, Manual
 * ```Observer``` observer pattern linking entities and Web App to support notifications in front-end
 * ```Decorator``` decorated entity to add a battery and seek charger entity when low battery
 * ```Command``` handler class to support input management for manual strategy pattern (not fully command pattern)
 * ```Singleton``` analytics used to output number of rescues and time taken

## Rubric
 * ```Factory``` 10 pts
 * ```Strategy``` (Automatic - 5pts, Target - 5pts, Manual - 5pts)
 * ```Observer``` 15 pts
 * ```Decorator``` EC up to 10pts
 * ```Charger Entity``` EC up 5pts
 * ```Command``` support-code or 10 pts
 * ```Image Detection``` 25 pts
 * ```Google Tests``` 10pts (5 unit and 1 integration)
 * ```Compilation``` 10pts
 * ```Singleton``` 10pts

 ## Lab Ideas

 * ```picojson and uml```
 * ```Patterns: Observer, forward declarations, and circular dependencies```
 * ```Patterns: Decorator (Starbucks menu example)```
 * ```Patterns: Strategy (Physics movement)```
 * ```Patterns: Command (Calculator example)```

 ## TODO
 * ```updated UML```
 * ```actual blob detection to return true or false```
 * ```finish analytics```
 * ```decide if we scrap anything```
